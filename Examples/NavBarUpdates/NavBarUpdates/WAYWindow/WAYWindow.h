/** This NSWindow subclass provides an interface to enable OS X 10.10 Yosemite exclusive features conveniently. Next to customizing the look of the WAYWindow content view, you can also customize the title bar and standard window buttons (`traffic lights´). The public interface is generally similar to INAppStoreWindow to simplify the migration.
 Whenever it makes sense, the properties of your WAYWindow instance in Interface Builder are inspectable.
 
 Tips:
 - Check out the WWDC '14 session `Adopting Advanced Features of the New UI of OS X Yosemite´, which provides more details on how to make use of the new Yosemite APIs.
 - Also check out the new APIs in NSScrollView to make use of contentInsets, scrollInsets, and more.
